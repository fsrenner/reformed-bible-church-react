    reformed: [
        `We subscribe to the reformed tradition of the protestant Christian faith. We affirm vital doctrines such as Sola Scriptura and Sola Fide. Sola Scriptura refers to the article that the Bible, as the inspired, infallible, and inerrant Word of God, is the sole written revelation that rules the faith and practice of the Christian community and alone can bind the conscience. Sola Fide refers to the doctrine of justification by faith alone whereby the believer is justified before God by the free grace of God by which He imputes the righteousness of Christ to the believer (Rom. 5:18-19). The sole ground of our justification is the merit of Jesus, which is imputed to all who put their trust in Him. Although good works flow necessarily and immediately from all justified persons, these works are not the meritorious grounds of our justification (Eph. 2:8-10).`,
        `We place great emphasis on the doctrine of God, which doctrine is central to the whole of its theology. In a word, Reformed theology is God-centered. The structure of the biblical Covenant of Grace is the framework for this theology. The concept of God's grace supplies the core of this theology.`

    confessional: [
        `We adhere to a written confession of faith that we believe to be a good and accurate summary of the Bible's teaching. Our confessional standards consist of the Westminster Confession of Faith and the Westminster Larger and Shorter Catechisms. While Scripture alone is to be the sole arbiter of our beliefs, we regard these standards as containing carefully worded summaries of the contents of sacred Scripture. Reformed Bible Church’s theology is “catholic” in that it reaffirms the doctrines of historic Christian orthodoxy such as defined by the Apostles Creed, and ecumenical councils of Nicea, Chalcedon, and others. These catholic doctrines include such affirmations as the Trinity, the deity of Christ, the atonement work of Christ, and other doctrines that are integral to historic Christianity. Acceptance of every confessional distinctive is not required for membership at Reformed Bible Church. An individual may be a participating member by affirming the evangelical distinctive that salvation is accomplished by grace alone through faith alone because of Christ alone.`

    covenantal: [
        `As Scripture indicates, God interacts with His people by means of covenant. A covenant is simply a legal agreement, or a binding contract, between two parties. Each party agrees to take upon him or herself the obligations of the covenant based upon the terms of the covenant. When God makes a covenant, He is the One Who delineates the terms since, after all, He is God. The Westminster Confession (7.1) states,`,
        `The distance between God and the creature is so great, that although reasonable creatures do owe obedience unto Him as their Creator, yet they could never have any fruition of Him as their blessedness and reward, but by some voluntary condescension on God's part, which He hath been pleased to express by way of covenant.`,
        `God established the first covenant, the Covenant of Works, with Adam (Gen. 2:4-25). When Adam broke the covenant and fell out of fellowship with God, God promised to Adam a New Covenant—a covenant not based upon our own works but upon the work of another (Gen. 3:15). The Old Testament is a continued unveiling of God's character through covenants which express more fully God's righteous requirements, but also foreshadow and prophesy the coming Messiah. As one reads the pages of the Old Testament, one comes to the realization again and again that God keeps His covenant promises, while His people do not. The New Testament is the record of God's fulfillment of His promise given in Genesis—to provide a New Covenant for His people that is not based upon our own works but upon the work of a savior.`,
        `Jesus Christ is this Savior. He is the ultimate revelation of God's character because He is God Himself; and, thus, He perfectly fulfills the requirements of the Old Covenant, the Covenant of Works. To put it another way, God keeps His promises made to His people by means of Himself. The work of Christ Jesus satisfied the justice of God and ushered in the New Covenant, the covenant in which God's grace is poured out upon sinners who could not keep the Covenant of Works. Rather than His people standing condemned, God has saved His people unto Himself by the finished work of Jesus Christ. The New Covenant is based upon faith in the work of Christ rather than our own meritorious works (Jer. 31:31-34).`
    ],
    ordinaryMeansOfGrace: [
        `God sovereignly establishes and increases faith through His ordained means, often called ordinary means of grace, which are vital for believers’ spiritual nourishment and growth. God’s people are therefore commanded to participate regularly in Lord’s Day corporate worship, in dependence upon God’s Spirit Who applies Christ’s benefits through His Word and sacraments. We therefore practice systematic expository preaching of God’s Word, recognize spoken and sung prayer as the chief means of gratitude and praise to God, and administer the sacraments of Baptism and the Lord’s Supper. We celebrate the Lord's Supper on the 1st Sunday and 3rd Sunday of each month. As such, we are a church governed by the ordinary means of grace. Although various ministries and fellowship opportunities certainly exist within our church community, we are not a program-driven church but an ordinary-means-of-grace-driven church.`
    ],
    familyIntegrated: [
        `We believe in intergenerational discipleship as a core value, which means that we seek the biblical model where the responsibility for disciple-making within the family relies primarily upon the parents, and particularly fathers, rather than on church programs. We do not have a segregated youth ministry, or children’s ministry. Children attend all of the corporate worship gatherings with their parents rather than attending a separate children’s ministry. Segregated children’s or youth ministries can work against God’s design. Parents relieved of their discipleship duties may become dependent on those who have taken over the job.`,
        `We teach parents to evangelize and disciple their children and their neighbors. We emphasize the ministry of hospitality, family worship, catechism, and family discipleship. Instead of placing the burden on paid professionals to “do the work of the ministry,” we equip the saints to do it.`
